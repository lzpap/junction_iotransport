Steps:

1. Upload the .ino file to a Genuino 101 board and connect DHT-22 sensor and HC-05 bluetooth module to the board via breadboard.

2. Run the Processing 3 application and open .pde file.

3. Wait 5s after uploading the code to the arduino board and hit run in processing: monitoring view appears with the sensor data from the board.
